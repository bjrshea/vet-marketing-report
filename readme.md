**Website summary:** This website is iVET360's hub for client benchmark reporting. My latest contriubtion to the site can be [found here](https://vetmarketingreport.com/vmbr/?hospital_name=Test+Hospital&domain=Yes&responsive=No&ssl=Yes&seo=No&analytics=Yes&ada=No&4g=3&exp_performance=46&exp_access=87&exp_practices=88&exp_seo=22&website_cta=Yes&marketing_cta=No&g_star=3&g_reviews=34&gmb_claimed=Yes&gmb_appt=No&gmb_desc=Yes&gmb_short=No&gmb_posts=Yes&gmb_offers=No&gmb_qa=Yes&gmb_ques=10&google_ads=No&fb_star=3&fb_recs=2&fb_likes=28&fb_followers=22&fb_checkins=25&fb_vanity=Yes&fb_branded=No&fb_mess=Yes&fb_offers=No&fb_ads=Yes&y_star=5&y_reviews=4&y_not_rec=22&y_claimed=No&y_checkin=Yes&y_comm=No&y_ques=4&y_ads=Yes&y_deals=No&y_posts=Yes&nd_claimed=No&nd_recs=6&nd_faves=22&nd_biz=Yes) (this is an example what a client would receive from our team). In a nutshell, I take hospital data via a form submission, pass that data to this results page by way of query string, and compare the data to industry averages in the veterinary community. This page is meant to give clients a comprehensive look at how their practice fairs against the industry, and uses conditional logic to display curated CTAs and promotions if the practice is missing the mark on specific metrics.

For a deep into the code on this page, check out the `functions.php` file, the `ivetJS/scripts.js` file, and the `custom.css` file.
