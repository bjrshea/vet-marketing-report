Website summary: This website is iVET360's hub for benchmark reporting for clients. My latest work to the site can be [found here](http://google.com). This page takes hospital data via a query string and compares to industry averages in the veterinary community. This page gives clients a comprehensive look at how their practice fairs against the industry, and use conditional logic to display curated CTAs if the practice is missing the mark on specific metrics.
